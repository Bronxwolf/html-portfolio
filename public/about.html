<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Web Developer with a few years in. I am originally from New York City. I relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 2022 to
  to focus more on my career as a Web Developer. I got into Web Developing in 2020 after the pandemic started. Being home with
  little to do, I decided to pick up a new skill. At the time I managed several fitness centers in New York City, so I did not
  get to put all of my focus into practicing web development, like I would have like to do. With the little experience that I did 
  have at the time, I knew eventually, that it was the career I wanted to pursue in the future. In 2022 I graduated from Devry University 
  with a degree in Computer Essentials. It allowed me to hone my skills in programming, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since then, I 
  have created many projects.
