<h1>The Best Movies According to Damien</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Little Shop of Horrors</h3>
<p>This is my absolute favorite movie of all time. I know every word to every song.</p>
<h3>Labryinth</h3>
<p>Its very similar to Little Shop of Horrors. Except there is way more fantasy and over the top animation.</p>
<h3>New Jack City</h3>
<p>Very different than my top 2, but it is the epitome of what a time based movie should be.</p>
